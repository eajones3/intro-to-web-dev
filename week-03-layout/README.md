# Week 3: Layout

Modify `index.html` and `styles.css` to create a website for a business.

The business can be real, imaginary, or aspirational. Get creative! Here are
some ideas:

- Your favorite local business
- A bookstore that only sells your favorite books
- A photography studio that specializes in pictures of your pet

Once you pick a business, modify the files in this directory to create a website
for your business.

Your website should contain at least the following:

- At least 3 pages that link between each other. You can use the example files
  in this directory, or you can delete them and come up with your own.
- 3 HTML elements in a flexbox container with `flex-direction: column`
- 3 HTML elements in a flexbox container with `flex-direction: row`
- 1 HTML element that displays differently based on the width of the window

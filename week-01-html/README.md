# Week 1: HTML

Modify `index.html` to introduce yourself.

Try to add at least 5 new tags that aren't already in the file. Here are some options:

- Add a link to your social media profiles, or to your favorite Wikipedia article.
- Show a list of your favorite books, songs, or movies.
- Show your favorite quote.
- Show a table of data, like your best run times, high scores, or your grades in your favorite classes.
- Add an image of yourself, your pet, or your favorite character.

Don't worry too much about what it looks like yet. You'll learn about styling your content next week!
